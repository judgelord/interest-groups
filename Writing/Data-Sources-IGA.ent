macro:->An
API
is
a
set
of
procedures
that
allow
a
user
to
access
data
from
a
website
in
a
structured
way.
Some
websites
limit
API
usage
by
requiring
users
to
get
an
API
key;
regulations.gov
is
one
of
those
websites.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {5}
macro:->By
emailing
\href
{mailto:regulations@erulemakinghelpdesk.com}{\nolinkurl
{regulations@erulemakinghelpdesk.com}}
with
`your
name,
email
address,
organization,
and
intended
use
of
the
API'.
See
\url
{https://regulationsgov.github.io/developers/}
for
more
details.
Approval
of
API
keys
takes
several
days.
We
caution
prospective
users
of
the
site
that
these
keys
can
be
deactivated
without
warning
or
acknowledgment
of
why
they
were
deactivated.

macro:->The
difference
between
the
total
number
of
reported
comments
and
the
number
of
comments
on
regulations.gov
is
often
due
to
mass
comment
campaigns
being
grouped
together.

macro:->Regulations.gov
is
subject
to
a
rate
limit
of
1,000
queries
per
hour
which
is
especially
problematic
for
scholars
seeking
to
analyze
the
full
text
of
comments,
many
of
which
are
included
only
as
attachments.
Downloading
an
individual
document
requires
calling
the
API
twice,
once
for
the
docket
information,
which
includes
the
attachment
URL(s),
and
then
a
second
time
to
download
the
linked
file.
\@endanenote 
\@doanenote {9}
macro:->For
example,
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
posts
all
comments
they
receive
on
their
eLibrary
website
but
only
posts
some
on
regulations.gov.
Unlike
regulations.gov,
most
agency
sites
do
not
have
an
API
and
thus
require
scholars
to
use
bespoke
web
scrapers.
We
have
examples
of
scrapers
for
several
of
these
agencies
on
\url
{https://github.com/libgober/regdata}.
While
these
websites
are
not
rate-limited
or
gated
with
API
keys,
we
recommend
caution
with
the
rate
at
which
scholars
solicit
information
from
the
servers
to
avoid
security
protocols
that
trigger
a
temporary
ban.
