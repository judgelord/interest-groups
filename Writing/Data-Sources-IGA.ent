macro:->An
API
is
a
set
of
procedures
that
allow
a
user
to
access
data
from
a
website
in
a
structured
way.
Some
websites,
like
regulations.gov,
limit
API
usage
by
requiring
users
to
get
an
API
key,

macro:->The
difference
between
the
number
of
reported
comments
and
the
number
of
comments
on
regulations.gov
is
often
because
some
agencies
group
mass-comment
campaigns
into
a
single
document.
A
small
number
of
comments
on
regulations.gov
are
duplicates
posted
in
error.
To
resolve
a
discrepancy,
we
recommend
searching
the
agency's
website
or
contacting
the
agency
directly.

macro:->For
example,
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
has
posted
all
comments
they
receive
on

website,
but
not
all
of
these
appear
on
regulations.gov.
Unlike
regulations.gov,
most
agency
sites
do
not
have
an
API
and
thus
require
bespoke
web
scrapers.

for
