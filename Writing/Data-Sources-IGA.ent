macro:->An
API
is
a
set
of
procedures
that
allow
a
user
to
access
data
from
a
website
in
a
structured
way.
Some
websites,
like
regulations.gov,
limit
API
usage
by
requiring
users
to
get
an
API
key.

macro:->The
difference
between
the
total
number
of
reported
comments
and
the
number
of
comments
on
regulations.gov
is
often
because
mass
comment
campaigns
are
grouped
together.

macro:->For
example,
the
Federal

Regulatory
Commission
has
posted
all
comments
they
receive
on
their
eLibrary
website,
but
not
all
of
these
appear
on
regulations.gov.
Unlike
regulations.gov,
most
agency
sites
do
not
have
an
API
and
thus
require
bespoke
web
scrapers.
We

examples
of
scrapers
for
regulations.gov
and
