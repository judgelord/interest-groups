macro:->An
API
is
a
set
of
procedures
that
allow
a
user
to
access
data
from
a
website
in
a
structured
way.
Some
websites
limit
API
usage
by
requiring
users
to
get
an
API
key;
regulations.gov
is
one
of
those
websites.

note
that
sometimes
the
difference

macro:->Regulations.gov
is
subject
to
a

1,000

is
especially
problematic
for

analyze
the

many
of
which
are
included
only
as

As
of
October
4,
2019
Regulations.gov
has
11,238,958
public

over
70
million
public
comments
and
almost
1.5
million
more
rules

other
