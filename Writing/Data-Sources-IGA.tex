these data. We discuss established databases such as regulations.gov,
which contains comments on draft rules proposed by executive branch
agencies, and new sources of data, such as ex-parte meeting logs, which
describe the interest groups and individual lobbyists that bureaucrats
are meeting face-to-face about proposed policies. One challenge is that
some of these data are not machine-readable. We argue that a productive
way forward is to invest in making all the datasets machine-readable and
to create a consistent way to link them to each other as well as to
other databases.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

If the U.S. federal government is unquestionably good at one thing, it
is pushing out paper. In theory, governmental records relevant to the
creation of regulatory policy via rulemaking have long been available to
researchers. Particularly when compared with adjudication, enforcement,
or other forms of individualized decision-making such as awarding grants
or contracts, public rulemaking is supposed to be transparent and
visible. The need for transparency in this quasi-legislative activity is
acute given the volume of rulemaking. Nevertheless, practically
speaking, obtaining information on what is happening during rulemaking
has been a costly and challenging undertaking. In the 1990s and early
2000s, leading research was limited to data on just a few rules
\citep[e.g.,][]{GoldenJPART1998} or using surveys
\citep[e.g.,][]{FurlongJPART2004}. Since 1994, when the government first
released the \emph{Federal Register} online, access to data on
notice-and-comment rulemaking has become increasingly detailed, and now
include data on draft policies, the activities of policymakers, and
interest group advocacy \citep[see][ for a recent review]{Yackee2019}.

In this article, we describe data sources that have proven useful to
scholars studying interest group lobbying of federal agencies, how to
obtain them, and also challenges in working with these data. Some of the
data sources we discuss are machine-readable records of all agency rules
published in the \emph{Federal Register}, comments posted on
regulations.gov, metadata about rules contained in the Unified Agenda,
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports. We also describe
sources that have become more available in recent years, such as
ex-parte meeting logs and individually-identified personnel records of
nearly all federal employees since 1973. For background theory on
lobbying and special interest influence over agency policymaking see
\citet{Carpenter2013}.

These data sources do not exhaust the kinds of records relevant to
researchers. They reflect what is available at present, but new data
sources emerge constantly. Thus, we also highlight sources of data where
complete datasets may soon become available, perhaps after enterprising
researchers submit the necessary Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA)
requests. Examples include agency press releases \citep[see,
e.g.,][]{LibgoberQJPS, Libgober2018} and the Foreign Agents Registration
Act (FARA) reports \citep{ShepherdAPSR2019}.\footnote{We link to more
  relevant data sources on our GitHub page:
  \url{https://github.com/libgober/regdata/blob/master/README.md}.} To
orient potential students of agency policymaking to available sources of
data, we identify four units of analysis: (1) participants, (2)
policymakers, (3) policy texts, and (4) metadata (e.g.~policy timing).
We describe where to find data on each in roughly the order that they
appear in the process of developing a rule.

\hypertarget{background-rulemaking-and-the-administrative-procedures-act}{%
\subsection{Background: Rulemaking and the Administrative Procedures
Act}\label{background-rulemaking-and-the-administrative-procedures-act}}

For decades, the volume of legal requirements emerging from executive
agencies has dwarfed the lawmaking activity of Congress, the Supreme
Court, and the Presidency. Each year, agencies publish three thousand or
more regulations. In doing so, agencies typically follow a process
prescribed by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. ยง
553(c). For each rule, agencies create a collection of documents at each
stage of their policymaking process. Section 553 requires agencies to
issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the \emph{Federal
Register} to notify potentially affected parties that the regulatory
environment or program administration may change. Following the NPRM,
agencies post these proposed rules and comments from interested
stakeholders and individuals on their websites or regulations.gov.
Agencies are required to consider public comments but are not required
to alter the rules based on them. These documents are organized in a
`docket' folder with a unique name and ID number. Once kept in literal
folders in each agency's `docket room', where visitors could make
photocopies, these documents are now online. For example, the Centers
for Medicare \& Medicaid Services rulemaking docket on health plans
disclosing costs can be accessed at
\href{regulations.gov/docket?D=CMS-2019-0163}{regulations.gov/docket?D=CMS-2019-0163}.
The fact that the APA requires agencies to assemble a comprehensive
record of who sought to influence the policymaking process -- and that
such records are relatively complete -- is unusual for federal
policymaking. This makes agency policymaking particularly exciting for
interest group scholars.

\hypertarget{who-participates-in-the-rulemaking-process}{%
\section{Who participates in the rulemaking
process?}\label{who-participates-in-the-rulemaking-process}}

Public attention in rulemaking is remarkably skewed. A few rules, such
as the Federal Communication Commission's rules on net neutrality,
receive millions of comments. In contrast, half of the proposed rules
open for comment on regulations.gov received no comments at all
\citep{LibgoberJOP}. Such dramatic variation in public participation
makes it difficult to think about the representative rule or rulemaking
participant. Important participants include businesses, public interest
groups, trade associations, unions, law firms, and academics
\citep{CuellarALR2005, YackeeJOP2006}. While businesses are the most
consistent and influential participants in most rulemakings
\citep{YackeeJOP2006, LibgoberJOP}, most comments are part of public
pressure campaigns targeting a relatively small number of rules -- at
least 39 million of the 48 million comments on proposed rules on
regulations.gov were mobilized by just 100 advocacy organizations such
as the Sierra Club \citep{judgelord2019SPSA}.

Because interest groups seek to influence rules, scholars are interested
in patterns of participation in rulemaking. For example,
\citet{YouJOP2017} finds that half of all spending on lobbying
legislation occurs \emph{after} a bill becomes law. Participation in
this process can begin even before a proposed rule is issued.
\citet{deFigureidoKimICC2004} show that meetings between agency
officials and firms spike before an agency issues a policy.
\citet{LibgoberQJPS} finds that firms that meet with federal regulators
before a rule is issued may receive abnormally high stock market returns
upon its release. Leveraging high-frequency trading data, Libgober shows
that in the minutes and hours following the publication of proposed
rules at the Federal Reserve, the firms that met with the Board during
rule-development significantly outperformed matched market competitors
that did not obtain such early access. These findings are consistent
with the analysis of qualitative researchers that commenters who
participate early in the rulemaking process can shape the content of the
rule \citep{NaughtonJPAM2009}.

Scholars are also interested in how participation in rulemaking may
affect a rule's ultimate fate when it is sent to the White House Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) or in judicial review. Interest groups
lobby successfully in OMB review \citep{HaederAPSR2015}. Interest groups
also use the rulemaking record to build a case for litigation. Yet,
there are few large-N studies linking lobbying in rulemaking to
litigation or court decisions. \citet{LibgoberRashin2018SPSA} analyzed
comments submitted to financial regulators and found that threats of
litigation were rare, and even comments that seemed to ``threaten''
litigation rarely culminated in a judicial decision. That said, the
overwhelming majority of court decisions involving challenges to rules
were preceded by comments that threatened litigation.
\citet{judgelord2016MPSA} found no relationship between the number of
comments and the likelihood that the Supreme Court upheld or struck down
an agency rule.

To analyze patterns of participation, scholars use data from a variety
of sources. Sources for data on participation are agency rulemaking
dockets
\citep{GoldenJPART1998, YackeeJPART2006, YoungBP2017, BanBP2019}, the
\emph{Federal Register} \citep{BallaAPSR1998, WestPAR2004}, and
regulations.gov \citep{BallaPI2019, GordonRashinJOP}. Though commenters
are not generally required to disclose their names and affiliations,
many do. The best current data sources for obtaining the names of the
organizations that submit comments on federal regulations are
regulations.gov and the websites of the independent agencies themselves.

\hypertarget{obtaining-and-working-with-data-on-comment-participants}{%
\subsection{Obtaining and working with data on comment
participants}\label{obtaining-and-working-with-data-on-comment-participants}}

Scholars wishing to obtain data on comments and commenters from
executive agencies generally use the website
\href{regulations.gov}{regulations.gov}. Actually obtaining the data
requires overcoming a number of technical and bureaucratic hurdles.
First, bulk data from the website can only be accessed via an
Application Programming Interface (API).\footnote{An API is a set of
  procedures that allow a user to access data from a website in a
  structured way. Some websites, like regulations.gov, limit API usage
  by requiring users to get an API key.} Second, obtaining an accurate
count of comments is not straightforward as agencies have different
policies regarding duplicated comments\footnote{The difference between
  the total number of reported comments and the number of comments on
  regulations.gov is often because mass comment campaigns are grouped
  together. Occasionally, comments on regulations.gov are duplicated. To
  resolve a discrepancy, we recommend searching the agency's website or
  contacting the agency directly.} and confidential business information
\citep{Lubbers2012}. Third, obtaining the data is time-consuming.
Regulations.gov is subject to a rate limit of 1,000 queries per hour,
problematic for scholars seeking to analyze the full text of comments,
many of which are as attachments. Downloading an individual document
requires calling the API twice, once for the docket information, which
includes the attachment URL(s), and then a second time to download the
linked file. As of October 4, 2019, Regulations.gov has 11,238,958
public submission documents representing over 70 million public comments
and almost 1.5 million rules and other documents. Not all federal
agencies post rulemaking documents to regulations.gov. Scholars studying
participation in these agencies can often obtain data on participation
in rulemaking from the agency websites.\footnote{For example, the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has posted all comments they
  receive on their eLibrary website, but not all of these appear on
  regulations.gov. Unlike regulations.gov, most agency sites do not have
  an API and thus require bespoke web scrapers. We have examples of
  scrapers for regulations.gov and several of these agencies on
  \url{https://github.com/libgober/regdata}.}

\indent After obtaining comment data, scholars must choose how they want
to preprocess the names of the organizations that comment. This step is
vital as organizations such as Goldman Sachs and the American Bar
Association, for example, submit comments using multiple versions of
their names. These decisions can have a substantial impact on the
analysis as misidentifying organizations may result in them being
dropped or double-counted. Fuzzy matching, using an algorithm to
identify the similarity (or "distance) between two strings of text can
help but is not a panacea. The algorithm will show small distances
between distinct entities (e.g., JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley), and it
cannot separate multiple organizations with the same acronym (e.g.,
ABA).

\hypertarget{who-writes-rules}{%
\section{Who writes rules?}\label{who-writes-rules}}

Political scientists have long used personal identity and social
networks to understand political outcomes. New data sources have made it
easier to learn about rulewriters' identities and networks. Some of the
most important data sources in this regard are the U.S. Office of
Personnel Management's (OPM) data on government employees
\citep[e.g.,][]{BoltonAMP2018},\footnote{Note that the dataset
  \citet{BoltonAMP2018} used is not public.} Open Secrets' lobbying
\citep[e.g.,][]{Baumgartner2009} and revolving door databases
\citep[e.g.,][]{VidalAER2012, BertrandAER2014}, machine-readable
lobbying disclosure act reports
\citep[e.g.,][]{BoehmkeJPP2013, YouJOP2017, Dwidar2019SPSA}, meeting
logs \citep{LibgoberQJPS}, and datasets of corporate board membership
such as Boardex \citep[e.g.,][]{ShiveROF2016}. \citet{CarriganPAR2019}
illustrate the possibilities of these new data sources. They find that
the number of job functions of the bureaucrats who write the rules is
associated with both decreases in the time an agency takes to promulgate
a rule and increases in the probability that the rule will be overturned
in court. In another innovative study, \citet{ChenJTP2015} link OPM data
to Bonica's DIME database in order to classify the ideology of agency
staff over time and apply these measures to study unionization. These
early efforts suggest that opportunities to study who writes the rules
and how it matters are prevalent. We expect such analyses to be a growth
area for years to come.

\hypertarget{obtaining-and-working-with-personnel-and-lobbying-data}{%
\subsection{Obtaining and working with personnel and lobbying
data}\label{obtaining-and-working-with-personnel-and-lobbying-data}}

Scholars can obtain data on agency personnel from the BuzzFeed personnel
data release, which contains information such as employee salaries, job
titles, and demographic data from 1973 through 2016.\footnote{Available
  at
  \url{https://archive.org/details/opm-federal-employment-data/page/n1}.
  Updated personnel files are available through 2018 from the OPM itself
  here: \url{https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/datadefn/index.asp}} These are
the most comprehensive personnel records publicly available, but they
have limitations. First, not all agencies and occupations are a part of
this release.\footnote{These data exclude at least 16 agencies and,
  within the covered agencies, law enforcement officers, nuclear
  engineers, and certain investigators \citet{Singer-Vine2017}.} Second,
some of the employees in these data do not have unique identification
numbers. This means that common names such as `John Smith' match
multiple employees; the Veterans Health Administration employed 24 John
Smiths in 2014, five with the same middle initial.

To obtain machine-readable data on the identities of domestic lobbyists,
scholars use two databases from Open Secrets -- a nonprofit that tracks
spending on politics -- on administrative and Congressional lobbying.
Downloading the lobbying data is straightforward; it only requires an
account to access the `bulk data' page. The lobbying data comes from the
required disclosures under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA).
Note that the reporting threshold varies by type of firm (in-house have
a higher minimum reporting threshold than lobbying firms) and over
time.\footnote{See
  \url{https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/ldaguidance.pdf} for
  details.} The lobbying data covers 1999 through 2018 and is broken up
into seven machine-readable tables.\footnote{These data can be
  downloaded here:
  \url{https://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/LDA_reports.htm}}
However, these data do not contain exact monetary amounts, and some
lobbyists do not disclose required contacts.\footnote{See
  \url{https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/698103.pdf}} Open Secret's
database is easier to use than the raw data. Open Secrets also has a
database on revolving door employees that shows the career paths or
federal government workers that went to the private sector and are
employed in some capacity where their work depends on interacting with
the federal government.\footnote{See
  \url{https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/methodology.php}} Unlike
their lobbying database, this one must be scraped as there is no option
to download it using bulk data.

Lobbyists advocating for foreign clients are required to disclose these
contacts under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. Foreign agents often
lobby bureaucratic agencies; Israel, for example, retained law firm
Arnold \& Porter for advice on registering securities with the
SEC.\footnote{See
  \url{https://efile.fara.gov/docs/1750-Supplemental-Statement-20110729-13.pdf}}
In addition to the participants, the reports also contain the nature of
the contact and the specific officials contacted. The data are
astonishingly complete - the website contains all 6264 FARA registrants
and their foreign contacts since 1942.\footnote{\url{https://efile.fara.gov/ords/f?p=1381:1:13132679194789}:::::}
Unlike other data discussed in this essay, the FARA data is \emph{not}
all in machine-readable form.\footnote{Only the metadata (e.g., names)
  are machine-readable.} Consequently, scholars using the data only
focus on a subset such as \citet{You2019} who focuses on lobbying
activities by Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. We caution users that
the same participant can be listed under multiple names.

Corporate executives, lawyers, and lobbyists often have contacts with
agency officials, called \emph{ex parte} communications
\citep{Lubbers2012}, to discuss rules outside of the public comment
process. While record-keeping practices for these meetings vary
considerably, they are often publicly available on agency
websites\footnote{Note that available does not mean conspicuous, as
  these logs are often hard to find by directly navigating the agency
  homepage.} Because meetings data are held in different places on each
agency's website, obtaining these data requires writing a web scraper
for each agency. As there are no uniform standards for reporting meeting
data, these data differ substantially from agency to agency in both
content and organization. The Federal Reserve, for example, groups
meetings by subject but not by rule,\footnote{\url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/communications-with-public.htm}}
the SEC groups meetings by rule, and the CFTC and FCC has all their
meetings in one place.\footnote{See
  \url{https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/ExternalMeetings?page=6}
  and
  \url{https://www.fcc.gov/proceedings-actions/ex-parte/archive-of-filings}}
Meeting participants are typically individually identified, but some
agencies only report the names of the organization represented, and
others report meeting topics but not participants. No study evaluates
the comprehensiveness of these record disclosures. We suspect that
missingness varies by agency.

\hypertarget{what-do-the-rules-say}{%
\section{What do the rules say?}\label{what-do-the-rules-say}}

The literature on rulemaking in political science and public
administration has focused on whether public participation influences
the content of rules
\citep[e.g.,][]{BallaAPSR1998, CuellarALR2005, YackeeJOP2006, NaughtonJPAM2009, Wagner_ALR_2011, HaederAPSR2015, HaederJPART2018, GordonRashinJOP, Rashin2019}.
Crucial to such commenter influence studies is knowing what the rules
say and how these texts have changed from proposal to finalization.
Especially useful to scholars is the rule's preamble, which describes in
detail what the agency has tried to accomplish and how it has engaged
with stakeholders. The legally operative text is often less useful to
social scientists since interpreting legal text often requires
substantial domain expertise. However, where interpretation is
straightforward, such as rate-setting, scholars can capture variation in
legally operative texts \citep{BallaAPSR1998, GordonRashinJOP}.

\hypertarget{obtaining-and-working-with-data-on-rule-text}{%
\subsection{Obtaining and Working with Data on Rule
Text}\label{obtaining-and-working-with-data-on-rule-text}}

The federal government publishes all rules in the \emph{Federal
Register}, accessible via FederalRegister.gov. This database is
comprehensive and has machine-readable records of all regulations
published after 1994 and optical versions form 1939-1993
(\url{https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/fr/}). The \emph{Federal
Register} API does not have any rate limits. The Federal Register office
assigns every regulatory action a document number. In our experience,
this `FR Doc Number' is the only truly unique and consistently
maintained identifier for proposed and final rules.

While the raw text of rules is relatively straightforward to obtain,
there are several thorny theoretical and methodological issues that
scholars must overcome.\footnote{We note that raw texts of rules are not
  available from regulations.gov or the independent agencies themselves.
  As these rules are often in PDF form, converting them to .txt for
  analysis introduces errors into the text.} First, the standard path
from notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to public comments to a final
rule is not always straightforward. Some rules are withdrawn before a
final rule. Other agencies issue interim final rules subject to
comments. For studies that seek to compare the proposed and final rules,
the most problematic rules are the ones where one proposed rule gets
broken up into a few smaller final rules or the reverse, where small
rules become bundled into one final rule. These rules pose challenges
for inference as the processes that lead to amalgamation or separation
are not well understood. Second, scholars must decide whether, and to
what extent, they should preprocess the rulemaking data before feeding
the data to a text analysis algorithm.

\hypertarget{obtaining-and-working-with-rule-metadata}{%
\section{Obtaining and working with rule
metadata}\label{obtaining-and-working-with-rule-metadata}}

Rulemaking metadata, such as the time rules are released, allow scholars
to answer questions about factors that affect the rulemaking
environment. Scholars use this data to study questions about regulatory
delay
\citep[e.g.,][]{ACSPSQ2013, ThrowerPSQ2018, PotterJOP2017, CarriganPAR2019, CarpenterAJPS2011},
agenda-setting\citep[e.g.,][]{CoglianeseALR2016}, and the financial
impact of rules \citep[e.g.,][]{LibgoberQJPS}. These scholars relied on
data from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)
\citep{ACSPSQ2013, CarriganPAR2019}, the Unified Agenda
\citep{CoglianeseALR2016, PotterJOP2017}, the \emph{Federal Register}
\citep{ThrowerPSQ2018}, press releases \citep{Libgober2018}, and FDA's
drug approval and postmarket experience \citep{CarpenterAJPS2011}.

Obtaining data from the Unified Agenda is relatively straightforward as
all of these documents since 1995 are available online in
machine-readable form.\footnote{The Unified Agenda from 1983 through
  1994 is available in the \emph{Federal Register}.} The Unified Agenda
contains many of the proposed regulations an agency plans to issue in
the near future, making it an extremely useful data source for studying
questions about agenda setting and timing \citep[e.g.,][]{Potter2019}.
There are, however, significant limitations to these data. First,
agencies report their early-stage rulemaking to the Unified Agenda
strategically \citep{NouSCLR2016}. Second, agencies do not list all
`failed' rules that did not become final rules in the Unified Agenda
\citep{YackeeGWLR2012}. Third, \citet{CoglianeseALR2016} note that the
Unified Agenda misses much of the regulatory agency's work, including
enforcement actions, adjudicatory actions, and decisions not to act.

As addressed elsewhere in this issue {[}NOTE: reference to OMB article
here{]}, many rules, especially rules that are controversial or deemed
economically significant, are reviewed by OMB's Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Obtaining OIRA data is relatively
straightforward, as all of these documents since 1981 are available
online in machine-readable form. These data include the date on which
OIRA received the rule from the agency, whether the review was
expedited, and whether the rule is determined to by `economically
significant' or affect `federalism'.

In addition to disclosures mandated by law, agencies often issue press
releases for agency actions. Much like the meetings data discussed
above, policies regarding the storage and dissemination of press
releases differ from agency to agency. The Federal Reserve, for example,
lists all press releases since 1996 on their website, while the SEC only
has them from 2012.\footnote{See
  \url{https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm} and
  \url{https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases}} When working with press
releases, scholars often need data on the exact time documents were made
available to the general public \citep[see, e.g.,][]{LibgoberJOP}. Press
release metadata, such as the exact time a press release becomes public,
can often be extracted from Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds.

Each data source has different types of missingness and different
limitations regarding the information it contains about each rule. For
example, data from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
(OIRA) only contains rules reviewed by OMB. The Unified Agenda (UA)
covers a broader scope of policies, but due to strategic reporting and
frequent reporting errors, desired cases may be missing. For published
rules, these missing cases may be found in a more reliable source like
the \emph{Federal Register}, which is more reliable than the UA, OIRA
reports, or regulations.gov, and thus the best source for rule texts.
However, the Federal Register contains the least amount of rule metadata
and only published drafts and rules. This means that some rulemaking
projects that were never finalized may be missing from all datasets.
More importantly, the diversity of these data sources means that, for a
given query, one source will often include cases that a second does not,
while the second source includes variables that first does not.

\section{Discussion: Assembling Complete
Databases}\label{discussion-assembling-complete-databases}}

The United States government releases troves of data on rulemaking but
in forms that require substantial effort from scholars to be useful for
research. Scholars working on bureaucratic politics face two primary
data challenges going forward: assembling complete, machine-readable
datasets of agency rulemaking activity and linking observations across
datasets. We see four fruitful data projects which could increase
researcher efficiency by preventing duplicated efforts to download and
clean data. First, a complete database is needed to link commenting
activity throughout the Federal government. Researchers should be able
to download these data in bulk, including comment text and metadata.
Second, a comprehensive database could link revolving door rulemakers
from the OPM personnel records, LDA disclosure forms, and FARA data.
This database would be significantly improved by the addition of data
from LinkedIn, but those data are not currently public. Third, creating
a database of all meeting activities throughout the federal government.
Finally, unique identifiers for each commenter would allow researchers
to link commenting behavior to organizations across datasets. These
projects, once completed, will allow scholars to pursue novel research
on political participation, influence, and public management.
